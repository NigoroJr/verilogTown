## Welcome to [verilogTown]

Welcome to [verilogTown]: a game of cars, crashes, and control.

[verilogTown] is a game that we designed so that people can solve city based
puzzles where cars need help to safely traverse the city. We, however, have an
ulterior motive, and that is to teach synthesizable Verilog design skills.  A
game approach allows people learning Verilog to fail, play, and challenge one
another, which are all important parts of learning that sometimes is not part
of a traditional digital lab.

## Trailer
